## Current AI Work  

Extended the **master’s dataset** into **PrimateOsteoID.ai** — an open-source ML classifier for **species, sex, and side** from 3D shoulder bones.  
**No undergraduate data will be used.**  
Code, models, and Streamlit app in **separate repo**.  
AI development assisted by **Grok (xAI)**.
